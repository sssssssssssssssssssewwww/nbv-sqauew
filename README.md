<h1 align="center">Ticket Bot 🎫</h1>

Ticket Bot is a discord bot focused on managing tickets channels, yes, it is free and 'open source', I have created Ticket Bot as an alternative to discord bots that charge you for premium functions!

## Features 🔥

Here are some of the features of this system.

1. **Highly customisable**    
You can customize everything you want about the bot, its messages, embeds, buttons and more.

2. **Easy to configure**    
Very easy to configure, just use the /config command and it will display an embed with the buttons to configure the bot

3. **Multi server system**     
The bot is optimized to work with many servers at the same time, so if you own multiple servers you won't have to host a bot for each one

4. **Transcription system**
When you close the ticket the bot will ask you if you want to save the transcript in a channel defined by you, if so the bot will send a ".html" file which will have a summary of all the messages that were sent in the channel
